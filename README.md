# myFlix-client2
 
<h1> Project Overview </h1>
<p>
A client-side development project using React for a movie database called myFlix2 App (originally it was myFlix but I deleted the whole project by mistake), based on its existing server-side code (REST API and database). myFlix App allows users to access information about different movies, directors, and genres.
