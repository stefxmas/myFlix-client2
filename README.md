# myFlix-client2
 
<h1> Project Overview </h1>
<p>
A client-side development project using React for a movie database called myFlix2 App (originally it was myFlix but I deleted the whole project by mistake), based on its existing server-side code (REST API and database). myFlix App allows users to access information about different movies, directors, and genres.
</p>

<h1>Key Features</h1>

The main features of the app allow users to:
*sign up and login to Profile
*browse movies in the database (including movie image, title and director)
*search for movies by movie title
*update their personal information
*create a list of their favorite movies
*log out or deregister
